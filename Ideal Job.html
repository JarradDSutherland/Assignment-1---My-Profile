    <p> This position is not the exact job I would be searching for, but the closest I could find in the field. I am looking for a career in games programming with a focus on Mobile app development, as this is an area that interests me and has such a large audience. Video games used to be very polarizing and werenâ€™t originally designed with women or the elderly in mind. Mobile games have subverted that drastically as nearly everyone has a smart phone in their pocket and is more willing to play a game for short bursts. So, I am interested in being a part of that cycle and help develop games in this market.
    Most roles in games programming require 2-3 years of experience in a similar position. They also require the applicant to be knowledgeable in a variety of languages including, C++, Python, JavaScript and of course Git. Also important is a requirement to have been involved in making a successful game reach market.
    My current skills towards this goal are minimal, as a lot of the self paced learning I have completed thus far has not been targeted specifically at games programming. I have only completed online short courses for basic networking and basic security coding. I have dabbled a little bit in game development software like Unity and have progressed through the tutorials to make mini games. I soon plan to begin production of my own game through Unity as well.
    My plan moving forward is to first and foremost complete the Bachelor of IT. Whilst studying I will endeavour to complete online short courses that specifically target C++ and Unity, as well as keep researching new technologies and platforms that become popular to ensure I am keeping on trend.
    After these studies, or perhaps even during the final year/s of study, I will apply for a junior role in games programming in order to obtain vital experience.
