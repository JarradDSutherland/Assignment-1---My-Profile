<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Jarrad Sutherland - S3927760 - S3927760@student.rmit.edu.au
    I am 32 years old and happily married with 3 children. My wife and I were both born in Australia and the only language spoken at home is English. I graduated Secondary college in 2007 and attended Chisholm TAFE the following year studying games programming, Cert IV. After completing the certificate, I enrolled in the Australian defence force reserves where I learned valuable lifelong lessons around leadership and teamwork. I have been working as a restaurant manager for the last 10 years and have since completed a Diploma of Management (Hospitality).
