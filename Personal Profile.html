        The results of these tests are more accurate than I first thought they would be, I was initially taken aback by the 16personalities results as I didn’t feel it accurately described me. Firstly I believe myself to be more introverted than extroverted and secondly I don’t think I am as judging as the test portrays,  but after diving deeper into the meanings I found myself agreeing on nearly every point, so I was pleasantly surprised.

        The learning style test again was close to the mark. I personally believe that I am more of a hands-on learner and therefore should fall in the Tactile category higher. But I do often find myself visualizing how a task should be completed and planning this out in my mind for proceeding. I definitely agree on the low score for Auditory as I find my mind wanders if I am not engaged in the audio content.

        I feel that these results show that when working in a team that I will be the analytical mind, that I will process the data and attempt to utilize this in a practical way. My team can use this to throw scenarios at me and I can attempt to work through them to find the usefulness or practicality of their solution.

        When forming a team, I should use this information to find people who may be more assertive and forward in their approach, this will help balance out the dynamic and not let the team get ground down in research and analysis and start to act.
