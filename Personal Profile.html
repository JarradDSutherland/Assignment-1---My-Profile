    <p>The results of these tests are more accurate than I first thought they would be, I was initially taken aback by the 16personalities results as I didnâ€™t feel it accurately described me, but after diving deeper into the meanings I found myself agreeing on nearly every point, so I was pleasantly surprised.
    The learning style test again was close to the mark, I do feel I am slightly more of a tactile learner than visual, but I do often find myself visualizing how I want things to look or what to do next, even if when learning I prefer a hands-on approach.
    I feel that these results show that when working in a team that I will be the analytical mind, that I will process the data and attempt to utilize this in a practical way. My team can use this to throw scenarios at me and I can attempt to work through them to find the usefulness or practicality of their solution.
    When forming a team, I should use this information to find people who may be more assertive and forward in their approach, this will help balance out the dynamic and not let the team get ground down in research and analysis and start to act.
